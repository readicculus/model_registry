- Add threshold to output csv info in format model_name@threshold

__ VIAME-JoBBS-Models-v2021.02.22 __
- Added config see configs/JoBBS.config
- Added synchronous(sync) trigger pipelines
- Added ir->eo seal only trigger pipeline.  Polar bear detectors are still poor and sometimes detect seals as bears with high confidence which overrides the seal detection so if evaluating for seal results this allows to exclude the polar bear detector.
- Added .bat files for windows command line usage

__ VIAME-JoBBS-Models-v2021.02.11 __
important:
- Fixed non-deterministic crashing
- Added limit to polar bear trigger chips as it overdetects quite a bit.  Set to 2 frames.  Set seal trigger limit to 30 chips.
- Added trigger threshold(set to 0.2 now) to subregion-trigger pipelines
other:
- Removed unnescessary pythread_per_process scheduler from non-python pipelines
- Added pipeline version and model name to output csv
